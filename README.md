# *Project Overview*

The "Memory Game: Star Wars" is a web-based game that challenges your memory while immersing you in the Star Wars universe. This project is a work in progress and is part of the October Automation Team Challenge.


# *Features*
Piano has the following features:

1. *Card Matching:* In the "Memory Game: Star Wars," you are presented with a grid of cards. Each card contains an image of a character or element from the Star Wars franchise. Your goal is to match cards with identical images by flipping them over.

2. *Interactive Play:*  You can interact with the game in the following ways:

- Click on a card to flip it over and reveal the image.
- Attempt to match two cards with the same image.
- If the cards match, they remain face up; otherwise, they flip back over.
- Click on 

3. *Scoring:* Your performance is scored based on how quickly you can match all the cards. Challenge yourself to improve your memory and beat your previous scores.

4. *Play with Music:* Choose your favorite Stars Wars soundtrack from the song list.

# *How to play:*
Users can use the piano as follows:

1. Click on a card to reveal the image.
2. Click on another card to try and find a match.
3. If the two cards match, they will remain face up.
4. If they do not match, they will flip back over.
5. Continue matching cards until you find all the pairs.

7. Compare your scores with your friends and see who can complete the game the fastest!
